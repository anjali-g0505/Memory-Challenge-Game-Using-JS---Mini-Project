# Memory-Challenge-Game-Using-JS---Mini-Project

A classic memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). Test your memory and pattern recognition skills by repeating increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. A fun, interactive project showcasing fundamental front-end development and game logic.


# How to Play
Start the Game: Press any key on your keyboard to begin.

Watch the Sequence: The game will light up a colored button and play a sound. This is the first step in the sequence.

Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the exact same order as the game showed you.

Advance Levels: If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will add another color to the sequence, and the level will increase.

Game Over: If you click the wrong button, the game will end, and you'll see a 'Game Over' message.

Restart: Press any key again to start a new game from Level 0.

# Features
Classic Gameplay: Replicates the addictive memory challenge of the original Simon Says game.

Visual & Audio Cues: Buttons light up and play distinct sounds for each color.

Progressive Difficulty: Sequences get longer and more challenging with each successful level.

Game Over State: Clear feedback when a mistake is made, prompting for a restart.

Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes.

# Technologies Used
HTML5: For the game structure and buttons.

CSS3: For styling the buttons, game area, and animations (e.g., button presses, game over flash).

JavaScript (ES6+): Implements all the game logic, sequence generation, user interaction, and state management.

jQuery: Used for DOM manipulation and event handling, simplifying JavaScript interactions.

Audio Files: .mp3 files for button sounds and the 'wrong' sound.
